Title: Vimeo Video Player Exercise by Tom Lee

Features Implemented
- The play button triggers play and pause and toggles between the play and pause icons.
- The buffer bar fills to match the loading progress of the video.
- The progress bar fills to match the play progress of the video.
- Displays and hides the video controls when the user hovers on and off of the video.
- Support for scrubbing: when the user clicks on the progress bar, the video updates to the specified time. 

FYI
- I purposely made the progress bars bigger since I personally think that a lot of video players have really small progress bar and it is difficult for the users to click and drag. 

Running the code
- Please go to the project directory on the terminal and type in "python -m SimpleHTTPServer". This will run the project locally. 

Thank you for giving me an interesting project to work on. This not only helped me demonstrate my skillsets for opportunities at Vimeo but also learn along the way. I'm a big fan of Vimeo and I really hope to talk to you guys soon. 

Cheers,

Tom Lee
